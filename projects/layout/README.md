#### > Breaking changes

`closeButtonLabel` and `backButtonLabel` inputs are removed.
You can override the translation provided by creating a custom provider for `NgxLayoutIntl` as show below or in demo-app.

#### > Configuration for internationalization

This library supports internationalization.

First of all you have to import the asset translation files like:

```
{
    ...
    "assets": [
        ...
        {
            "input": "node_modules/@hug/ngx-layout/public/translations",
            "glob": "**/*",
            "output": "public/translations/ngx-layout"
        }
    ]
}
```

You can choose another output path, but you will need to override the default value in the `provideNgxLayout('my/custom/output/path')`.

Then you have to provide `provideNgxLayout()` ; you call provide it globally in your main `ApplicationConfig` like:

```typescript
import { NgxLayoutIntl, provideNgxLayout } from '@hug/ngx-layout';

export const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
    providers: [
        NgxLayoutIntl,
        provideNgxLayout()
    ]
};
```

Note that you can also override specific translation entries by providing a custom class implementation like:

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class CustomNgxLayoutIntl extends NgxLayoutIntl {
    public override closeLabel = '***My custom closeLabel***';
}

export const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
    providers: [
        {
            provide: NgxLayoutIntl,
            useClass: CustomNgxLayoutIntl
        },
        provideNgxLayout()
    ]
};
```
